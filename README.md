Taking inspiration from nuttylmao and ryzetech Cider Music Widget, I developed a Music Player Widget for Apple Music users who wish to display their music on stream. I took a bit of an inspiration from the Apple Music Player UI to develop the look.


**THIS APP REQUIRES CIDER(PREFERABLY V2+, which costs US$3.49.**
**Get Cider here:

Here's a preview of how the player will look once you import and get it working properly:

Instructions on how to use this Widget:

1. Download and Extract the ZIP file where you'd want to save it locally in your system.
2. Create a new Browser Source in OBS and right above URL select Local File
